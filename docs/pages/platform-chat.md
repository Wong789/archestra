Archestra includes a built-in Chat interface that allows users to interact with AI agents using MCP tools. To use Chat, you need to configure LLM provider API keys.

### API Keys
Chat will use LLM API Keys configured in Settings -> LLM API Keys. When a chat request is made, the system determines which API key to use in this order:

1. **Profile-specific key** - If the profile has an API key assigned for the provider, use it
2. **Organization default** - Fall back to the organization's default key for that provider
3. **Environment variable** - Final fallback to `ARCHESTRA_CHAT_<PROVIDER>_API_KEY`

### Supported Providers

See [Supported LLM Providers](/docs/platform-supported-llm-providers) for the full list.

## MCP Apps

MCP servers can expose interactive UI panels alongside tool results. When a tool's definition includes a UI resource URI, Chat renders the app inline below the tool call instead of showing raw JSON output.

MCP Apps run inside a double-sandboxed iframe: an outer proxy iframe on a separate origin enforces CSP, and an inner iframe renders the untrusted HTML. The two iframes communicate with the host page via the AppBridge protocol.

**Display modes** — Apps start inline and can request fullscreen via the AppBridge protocol. Press Escape or the close button to return to inline.

**Tool calls from apps** — An MCP App can invoke tools on its own MCP server directly from the UI. These calls are proxied through `/api/mcp/{agentId}` and appear in the chat history like any other tool call.

**Permissions** — Camera, microphone, geolocation, and clipboard-write access are opt-in. The MCP server must declare them in the resource `_meta.ui.permissions` field; the user's browser will prompt for consent as normal.

## Security Notes

- API keys are stored encrypted using the configured [secrets manager](/docs/platform-secrets-management)
- Keys are never exposed in the UI after creation
- Profile assignments allow separation of billing/usage across teams
